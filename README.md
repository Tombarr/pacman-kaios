## Install & run:

Built files are stored in a `dist` folder. To run the game, a static server is needed.

- With NodeJS:
  - Using yarn:

  ```bash
  yarn && npm start
  ```

  - Using npm:

  ```bash
  npm install && npm start
  ```

Webpack will run webpack-dev-server on `localhost:3000` with BrowserSync on `localhost:4000`.
